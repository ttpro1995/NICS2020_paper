abstract = "Estimating count and density maps from crowd images has a wide range of applications such as video surveillance, traffic monitoring, public safety and urban planning. In addition, techniques developed for crowd counting can be applied to related tasks in other fields of study such as cell microscopy, vehicle counting and environmental survey. The task of crowd counting and density map estimation is riddled with many challenges such as occlusions, non-uniform density, intra-scene and inter-scene variations in scale and perspective. Nevertheless, over the last few years, crowd count analysis has evolved from earlier methods that are often limited to small variations in crowd density and scales to the current state-of-the-art methods that have developed the ability to perform successfully on a wide range of scenarios. The success of crowd counting methods in the recent years can be largely attributed to deep learning and publications of challenging datasets. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approaches that have demonstrated significant improvements over earlier methods that rely largely on hand-crafted representations. First, we briefly review the pioneering methods that use hand-crafted representations and then we delve in detail into the deep learning-based approaches and recently published datasets. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and drawbacks of existing CNN-based approaches and identify promising avenues of research in this rapidly evolving field."

Several deep learning based DCC methods have achieved the state-of-arts on public datasets. However, experimental results show that the scale variation is still the main factor to hinder the DCC performance. In this work, we propose a scale-informed dense crowd counting method focusing on handling the negative effect caused by scale variation. More specifically, we propose a method to obtain the scale information of the patch from its GT density maps via estimating the mean value of the Gaussian kernel width and then a scale-classifier is deigned and trained accordingly. Moreover, with the estimated scale information, two sub-nets are dedicatedly deigned to learn the density maps for large-scale head patch and small-scale patch separately. Experimental results validate the performance of our proposed method which achieves the best performance on three dense crowd datasets.},  keywords={feature extraction;Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis;large-scale head patch;small-scale patch;dense crowd datasets;scale-informed density estimation;dense crowd counting;scale variation;DCC methods;DCC performance;scale-informed dense crowd;GT density maps;scale-classifier;estimated scale information;Crowd Counting;Density Estimation;Classifier;Gaussian Kernel Width;Convolutional Neural Network},  doi={10.1109/VCIP47243.2019.8965799},  ISSN={2642-9357},  month={Dec},}

abstract = {Crowd density estimation is an important task in the surveillance camera system, it serves in security, traffic, business etc. At the present, the trend of monitoring is moving from individual to crowd, but traditional counting techniques will be inefficient in this case because of issues such as scale, clutter background and occlusion. Most of the previous methods have focused on modeling work to accurately estimate the density map and thus infer the count. However, with non-human scenes, which have many clouds, trees, houses, seas etc, these models are often confused, resulting in inaccurate count estimates. To overcome this problem, we propose the "Weighted Sum of Regressors and Human Classifier" (WSRHC) method. Our model consists of two main parts: human -- non-human classification and crowd counting estimation. First of all, we built a Human Classifier, which filters out negative sample images (non-human images) before entering into the regressors. Then, the count estimation is based on the regressors. The difference between regressors is the size of the filters. The essence of this method is the count depends on the weighted average of the density map obtained from these regressors. This is to overcome the defects of the previous model, Switching Convolutional Neural Network (Switch-CNN) select the count as the output of one of the regressors. Multi-Column Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) combines the count and the weight of the Regressors by fixed weights from MCNN, while our approach is adapted for individual images. Our experiments have shown that our method outperform Switch-CNN, MCNN on ShanghaiTech dataset and UCF_CC_50 dataset.},
