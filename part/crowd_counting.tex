\section{Challenges in Single Image Crowd Counting}
Surveying recent works, we summary difficulty in crowd counting in two challenges

Scale variation: Perspective distortion causes people size to variance depending on the camera angle and how far people from the camera is often referred to as a multi-scale problem. As a result, people near camera seem larger than those stay far away. Multi-scale problem may cause variance in density crowd density distribution (i.e: big heads take more space than small heads). Scales can change between scene or vary radically in the same image. Therefore, the typical CNN model cannot fully adapt to the scale-variance effect.

Given any image I,
