\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed DCCNN, a lightweight model with mechanisms to tackle both perspective distortion and background noise challenges. By replacing the tail part of the model with dilated convolution and two max pooling with average pooling, DCCNN can better incorporate spatial information. As a result, DCCNN delivered sharper density maps with less noise. We demonstrated our model in medium and spared dataset ShanghaiTech part B \cite{zhang2016single} with C-CNN \cite{9053780} to compare their performance and efficiency.

% In this work, we proposed utilized dilated convolution to upgrade C-CNN \cite{9053780} into DCCNN. DCCNN is as light-weight as C-CNN. However, the performance boost on medium and spares crowd scene is significant.
