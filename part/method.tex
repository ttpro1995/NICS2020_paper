\subsection{Dilated convolution neural network}
Despite their performance, state-of-the-art models are complex. C-CNN is a bargain trade performance for efficiency. However, there is still room for improvement, while its light-weight characteristic is reserved. 

Dilated CNN have been  Inspired from CSRNet \cite{li2018csrnet} and CAN \cite{liu2019context}, we replace layer all tradition CNN on second layer with Dilated CNN at dilated rate 2. We apply batch normalization \cite{ioffe2015batch} with trainable parameters on each layer, including first multi-scale layers. Follow authors work, we add batch normalization before the nonlinearity, in our case, ReLU \cite{agarap2018deep}.
