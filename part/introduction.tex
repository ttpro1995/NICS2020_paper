\section{Introduction}

With the development of urbanization and mass surveillance, automated crowd scene understanding, with crowd counting as a sub-problem, become in-demand. Single-image crowd counting in computer vision is the process to automatically count the number of people in an image using a computer.  The topic of single-image crowd counting remain challenging.

Recent works on crowd counting focus on tackle two main challenges: Scale variation caused by perspective distortion and background noise. Despite state-of-the-art works robust to both the above challenges, their models are too complex and resource hungry \cite{liu2019context, jiang2019crowd, liu2019adcrowdnet, amirgholipour2020pdanet}. C-CNN \cite{9053780} was proposed as a lightweight approach. However, C-CNN does not cover all problems of crowd counting.

In this paper, we show that C-CNN performance can be improve significant without increase on model complexity.
